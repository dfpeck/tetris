# tetris
Terminal tetris using ncurses. Very unfinished, many expected features will be missing.

## Building
1. Ensure [ncurses developer libraries](https://ostechnix.com/how-to-install-ncurses-library-in-linux/) are installed.
2. Run `make` in directory.
3. A standalone tetris binary will be output in that same directory.
